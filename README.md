# 💫 About Me:
👋🏻 **Hi, I'm Itakello!**

🔭 **I'm currently exploring** ways to build innovative applications using LLMs—aiming for solutions that are visually appealing, well-structured, scalable, and efficient. I'm passionate about creating truly impactful tools, although I'm still on the journey of building something I can feel genuinely proud of.

🤝🏻 **I'm looking forward to collaborating** on open-source projects that are spicy, practical, productivity-focused, autonomous, scalable, visually attractive, and easily integrable with various services and operating systems. Let's create something awesome together!

🖤 **I'm currently learning** about AI agents, MCPs, quantitative trading, scaffolding, and workflow automation tools like n8n. Always eager to discuss these topics or exchange ideas!

💬 **Ask me about** AI, AGI, the future of technology and society, Universal Basic Income (UBI), Universal Basic Services (UBS), or just geek out on what's next for humanity.

⚡ **Fun fact:** I identify as a 🦃—yes, a turkey! It’s a long story, but let's just say I'm proudly feathered and ready for innovation.

Feel free to reach out—I'm always up for a chat, a collaboration, or just brainstorming some wild ideas! 🚀
